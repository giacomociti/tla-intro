Specifying Systems
==================

- A specification is a written description of what a system is supposed to do.

- Specifying a system helps us understand it.

- Our basic tool for writing specifications is mathematics.

- We define a behavior to be a sequence of states, where a state is an assignment of values to variables.

- We specify a system by specifying a set of possible behaviors - the ones representing a correct execution of the system.

- Temporal logic is a necessary evil.
