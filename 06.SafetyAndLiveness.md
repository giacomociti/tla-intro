Safety and Liveness
===================

- Safety Properties

    - What a system must _not_ do (bad things should never happen).

    - They don't require that the system ever actually do anything.

    - If a safety property is violated, it is violated at some particular
    point in the behavior.

    - These properties, which can be specifed with almost no temporal logic,
    are all that most engineers need to know about.

- Liveness Properties

    - What a system should do (good things do happen eventually)

    - Fairness is enough
